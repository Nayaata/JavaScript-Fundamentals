# JavaScript-Fundamentals :mortar_board:
__JavaScript__ is an interpreted, object-based scripting language. The JavaScript language uses a syntax similar to that of C, and supports structured constructs, such as if...else, for, and do...while. Braces ({}) are used to delimit statement blocks. The language supports various data types, including String, Number, Boolean, Object, and Array. It includes support for enhanced date features, trigonometric functions, and regular expressions. JavaScript uses prototypes instead of classes. You can define an object by creating a constructor function. JavaScript is a loosely typed language, which means you do not declare the data types of variables explicitly. In many cases JavaScript performs conversions automatically when they are needed. For example, if you add a number to an item that consists of text (a string), the number is converted to text.
